     	Have we are making sweet AJAX-powered tabs with css3 and<br> 
     	newly realeased version 1.4 of Jquery.<br>

     	Organizing the content of a page in a both intuitive and<br> 
     	eye-catching manner, is a must in modern web design.<br>
     	One principle that has been around for some time is dividing <br>
     	text into tabs. This allows you to squeeze much more content<br>
     	in a seemingly limited space and provide a structured way of accessing it.<br>

         Today we are making an AJAX-powered tab page with CSS3 and<br>
         the newly released version 1.4 of jQuery, so be sure to<br>
          download the zip archive from the button above and continue with step one.
